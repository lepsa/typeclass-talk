You can restrict what types can have instances with typeclass
restrictions and kinds.

For extra kicks you can give typeclass members default definitions.

  bar :: t a -> t b -> t b
  bar a b = foo a $ \_ -> b

Sometimes semigroup reuses existing functions that describe specific semantics.

```haskell
data Map k a = Bin Int k a (Map k a) (Map k a) | Tip

instance Ord k => Semigroup (Map k v) where
  (<>) = union

instance Semigroup (Vector a) where
  (<>) = (++) -- From Data.Vector

Getting the first or last value.

newtype Last a = Last { getLast :: Maybe a }
instance Semigroup (Last a) where
  a <> Last Nothing = a
  _ <> b            = b

The one law that a semigroup must follow is the the function must be associative.

And that will compile, but there is an error lying in wait to catch us out.

If I have some lists of data that I wanted to join together, I could send
subsets of my data out to computers to concatenate, and collect their answers.
So long as I keep the order of the responses, it doesn't matter in what order
I combine the results in.

```haskell
l   = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12] ]

l1  = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
l1' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

l2  = [ [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12] ]
l2' = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

l' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
]

.left-column[
# Semigroup
## Examples

]
.right-column[
Sadly Haskell doesn't have a built in way of enforcing these laws.

That doesn't mean we have to give up all hope. We can write tests that check
that the properties of the typeclass hold for arbitary given values.

This usually goes by the name 'property testing'.

Other languages take this further and make you prove that your code is
correct.

.left-column[

.right-column[
List forms a monoid with the empty list as its mempty values.
```haskell
[] <> [1] <> [] <> [2, 3]  ==  [1, 2, 3]

`""` is the mempty for string.
```haskell

]
---

.left-column[
  # Monoid
  ## Examples

.right-column[
`Sum` and `Product`, newtypes for the summation and products of numbers, are both monoids.
`Sum` uses `0`, and `Product` uses `1` for `mempty`.

newtype Sum a = Sum { getSum :: a }

instance Num a => Semigroup (Sum a) where
  (<>) a b = Sum $ getSum a + getSum b

instance Num a => Monoid (Sum a) where
  mempty = Sum 0

Sum 0 <> Sum 1 <> Sum 2 <> Sum 0  ==  Sum 3

newtype Product a = Product { getProduct :: a }

instance Num a => Semigroup (Product a) where
  (<>) a b = Product $ getProduct a * getProduct b

instance Num a => Monoid (Product a) where
  mempty = Product 1

Product 1 <> Product 2 <> Product 3 <> Product 1

Monoids are an excellent data structure to use when your computation has some
  connotation of nothingness, or you need a base value that you can build up from.

If I was trying to give you the result of a computation that might fail, I would probably use `Maybe`.

Computations that return 0 or more results, such as database queries, often
return data in lists.

Both of these types are able to collect their results, while ignoring invalid or
missing data.

**NonEmpty** the non-empty list.

As its name might suggest, doesn't encode an empty value, as it will always

`NonEmpty` can be a Semigroup, but it cannot be a Monoid.

```haskell
instance Semigroup (NonEmpty a) where
  (a :| as) <> (b :| bs) = a :| (as <> (b : bs))

instance Monoid (NonEmpty a) where
  mempty = ???

The stronger the typeclass is, the more you can do with it, but your available instances begin to dwindle.

Sadly this is not the case in haskell today, as of GHC 8.2.1 semigroup uses the
Monoid version of `<>` (called `mappend`) by default, and is not a superclass of Monoid.

(But let's pretend that they are, GHC 8.4 will be fix this)

## Questions?

Foldable types offer functions that allow you to run a function over each value

---

.left-column[
# Foldable
]
.right-column[
Foldable types offer functions that allow you to run a function over each value
in order, collecting the results.

The two basic folds that all others are built from are `foldl` and `foldr`.

`foldl` can be thought of as summation or being a bit like a for-loop. `foldr` tends
to be better thought of as being a type replacing function, but both
work for either case.

```haskell
class Foldable t where
  foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> t b -> a
  foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

  fold :: Monoid m => t m -> m

  foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> t a -> m
```
]

---

.left-column[
#Foldable
##Examples
]
.right-column[
[a] and NonEmpty are prime examples of a Foldable data structures, but not all
Foldables have to store multiple or varying amounts of values.

The folds for Maybe will return either z or the result of the function.

Sum, Product, First, Last, and other similar types are all Foldable, operating
on their stored value.
]

---

.left-column[
#Foldable
##Examples
##Laws
]
.right-column[
  Foldable comes with a set of laws that mostly deal with ensuring the order in
  which function application occurs.
  
  Some of the concepts used in these laws are a little beyond the scope of this talk.
  
  An intuitive understanding of `foldl` and `foldr` is that they must run in opposite directions.

```haskell
l = [1, 2, 3]
f = (+)

foldl f z l == ((z + 1) + 2) + 3
foldr f z l == 1 + (2 + (3 + z))
```

---

.left-column[
# Functor

.right-column[
Functors are an interesting and fundamental part of haskell programming.
They allow you to apply a function over values that have some context.

How would you apply a function to:<br/>
Every item in a list?<br/>
An optional value?<br/>
One of two possible values?<br/>
Trees of values?<br/>
]

---

.left-column[

#Functor
]
.right-column[
For each of these types you would probably end up with functions with types of
```haskell
applyList   :: (a -> b) -> [] a       -> [] b
applyMaybe  :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a    -> Maybe b
applyEither :: (a -> b) -> Either e a -> Either e b
applyTree   :: (a -> b) -> Tree a     -> Tree b
```

These all look very similar, all that we are doing is changing the data type holding our values.

So, how do we abstract over data types? If you thought typeclasses then congrats! You have been paying attention.

]

---

.left-column[
#Functor
]
.right-column[
This is Functor
```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Infix version used everywhere
(<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(<$>) = fmap
```

And this is what a functor instance looks like.
```haskell
class Functor [] where
  fmap _ []     = []
  fmap f (x:xs) = f x : fmap f xs

instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing
  fmap f (Just a) = Just (f a)

instance Functor (Either e) where
  fmap _ (Left x)  = Left x
  fmap f (Right y) = Right (f y)
```
]

---

.left-column[
#Functor
##Laws
]
.right-column[
Like all good typeclasses, Functor must have some laws that we can use.
```
fmap id == id

fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g
```

So, what do these laws mean in practice?
Well, if I run the identity function `\x -> x` over the elements of something,
I should get the same values back.

Additionally, if I run one function over the structure, then another it should be the
same as doing both at the same time per element.

This is basically the function composition law, but now we are applying it to values in a context.
]

---

.left-column[
#Functor
##Laws
##Examples
]
.right-column[
As shown earlier [], Either, are all relatively straight forward Functors.

Much like the Foldable instances, Functor for Maybe, First, Last, Sum, Product will apply the function to the stored value, re-wrapping the result.
```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap _ Nothing = Nothing
  fmap f (Just a) = Just $ f a

-- You can swap out Sum for First, Last, Product, etc
instance Functor Sum where
fmap f s = Sum ( f $ getSum s )
```

NonEmpty's instance is very similar to the instance for [], so much so that we can use it.
```haskell
instance Functor NonEmpty where
  fmap f (a :| as) = f a :| fmap f as

```

]

---

.left-column[
#Functor
##Laws
##Examples
]
.right-column[
A trivial application of Functor would be something like this.
```haskell
(+ 1) <$> [1, 2, 3]  ==  [2, 3, 4]
```

You can use functor to build functions.
```haskell
(+) <$> Just 1  ==  Just (+ 1)

```

You can even use it to apply functions with multiple params
```haskell
(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b

f a b c = a + b + c
(3 &) <$> (2 &) <$> f <$> Just 1  ==  Just 6

g a b c = a <> b <> c
("2" &) <$> ("1" &) <$> g <$> ["A", "B", "C"]  ==
  ["A12", "B12", "C12"]
```

There are nicer ways of doing this that I'll cover in another talk.

.left-column[
#Functor
##Laws
##Examples
##Pseudo Example
]
.right-column[
In haskell today, Data.Set from containers is not a functor, although you might want it to be.

This is due to the implimentation of Set and its related functions requiring Ord instances for the
held type. Functor doesn't allow this, as you must be able to return any
value.

To work around this, Data.Set supplies a function `map` that has these
restrictions that otherwise works just like `fmap`.

An interesting thing about Functors is that they do not have to be structure
preserving, but often are. The above pseudo-functor for Set will drop duplicate
values, possibly resulting in a smaller Set everytime you run `map`.

.right-column[
And it works well, because I wrote it.

But when you feed it really big lists it can take a while to run.


You talk to your friend and they say that haskell lists are actually linked
lists and those are slow. You should use Vector instead, which is more like an
array.

So you begin the task of changing all those list annotations over to Vector, changing how you loop over the values.

If this sounds slow, boring, and error prone you would be correct.

In this case we can easily remove applyFunction and replace it with a functor,
and the list pattern match with a fold.

```haskell
myFancyCounter :: Functor f =>
  f Int -> (Int -> Int) -> Int
myFancyCounter v f = sumValues $ fmap f v

sumValues :: Vector Int -> Int
sumValues v = foldr (+) 0 v

app :: Vector Int -> Int
app v = myFancyCounter v (+ 1)
```
]

But what if our values get too big for Int? So we move to Integer. 

What if we no longer want to sum the values but get the product instead?
Now we need to remember if we used any special values anywhere and change those.

If we change out the Integer type to be a Monoid we can capture all those requirements in one nice place.
```haskell
myFancyCounter :: (Monoid m, Functor f) =>
  f m -> (m -> m) -> m
myFancyCounter v f = sumValues $ fmap f v

sumValues :: Monoid m => Vector m -> m
sumValues v = foldr (<>) mempty v

app :: Vector Sum -> Sum
app v = myFancyCounter (+ 1) v
```
]

There is still that lingering Vector in sumValues. Since we are already using foldr we can easily change it to work on any Foldable type

```haskell
myFancyCounter :: (Monoid m, Foldable f, Functor f) =>
  f m -> (m -> m) -> m
myFancyCounter v f = sumValues $ fmap f v

sumValues :: (Foldable f, Monoid m) => f m -> m
sumValues v = foldr (<>) mempty v

app :: Vector Sum -> Sum
app v = myFancyCounter (+ 1) v
```

Now if we want to change the data type that our app uses, it is all in one place!

We can simplify this even further using another function from Foldable.

```haskell
myFancyCounter :: (Monoid m, Foldable f) =>
  f m -> (m -> m) -> m
myFancyCounter v f = foldMap f v
```

And that is the power of Typeclasses in practice.
